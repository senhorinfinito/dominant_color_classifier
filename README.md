# Classify-Images-by-Dominant-Color

## Task
Classify images by dominant color in one of the total 9 groups groups. 

## Equation
x=x/(total-grey) where x stand for no. of R,G,B pixel in image, total is size of image and grey for no of scale colors.  

## Requirements
    pip install -r pip-requirements.txt
    
## Usage
Put input folder in the root folder and simply run jupyter notebook:
 
    Classification.ipynb
    

## Limitation
i. There is a resize operation in preprocessing step, the resized image is 10*10.  
since we do not care about the features in image, Only RGB is important.  
Some of R,G,B maybe classify to "other" due to compress pixels reasons.  
ii. Looking into the equation:  
x=x/(total-grey)  
There is a situation that image only contain grey scale color. So the equation is modified to:  
x=x/(total-grey+1)
